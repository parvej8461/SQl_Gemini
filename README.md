# SQl_Gemini
End to End Text to SQL LLM App along with Quering SQL database using Gemini Pro

Absolutely! Here's a refined README description for your GitHub project, incorporating best practices and highlighting the project's value:

**End-to-End Text to SQL LLM App with Gemini Pro**

This project demonstrates a powerful application that bridges natural language processing (NLP) and database interactions. It leverages the advanced capabilities of Google's Gemini Pro model to translate plain English questions into structured SQL queries. These queries are then executed directly on your SQL database (in this case, SQLite), enabling seamless data retrieval.

**Key Features**

* **Intuitive Interface:**  A user-friendly Streamlit web app provides a simple text input box for asking questions about your data.
* **Intelligent Translation:** The Gemini Pro LLM, fine-tuned for SQL generation, accurately converts natural language queries into valid SQL code.
* **Seamless Database Integration:** Queries are executed directly on your SQLite database, returning results in an organized format.
* **Customization:** Easily adapt the project by modifying the database schema or adjusting the Gemini Pro prompt for more tailored responses.

**How It Works**

1. **User Input:** The user enters a question in plain English (e.g., "How many students are in the Data Science class?").
2. **Gemini Pro Conversion:** The Gemini Pro model processes the question and generates the corresponding SQL query (e.g., "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STUDENT WHERE CLASS='Data Science';").
3. **Query Execution:** The generated SQL query is executed on the connected SQLite database.
4. **Results Display:** The query results are neatly displayed within the Streamlit app.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python (3.7 or higher)
   - Google Cloud Project with Gemini Pro access
   - SQLite database with your data
2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository.
   - Set up your `.env` file with your Google API key.
   - Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the App:**
   - `streamlit run app.py`

**Example Usage**

```
Input: Tell me all the students studying in Data Science class?
Output: ('John Doe', 'Data Science', 'A')
         ('Jane Smith', 'Data Science', 'B') 
```

**Potential Enhancements**

* **Support for More Databases:** Extend the project to work with PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for invalid queries or database connections.
* **Interactive Data Visualization:** Incorporate charting libraries (e.g., Plotly) to visualize results.

**Disclaimer:** This project is a demonstration of the capabilities of text-to-SQL LLMs. Be sure to thoroughly test and validate the generated SQL queries before applying them to production databases.
